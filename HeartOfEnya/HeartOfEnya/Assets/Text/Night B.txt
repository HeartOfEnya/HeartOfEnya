-> Welcome back.
Raina: Hey there, Willow.
-> You’re not sitting with the others?
Raina: I thought I’d take some time for myself.
-> You’ve had a long day.
Raina: Yes, that’s one way to put it. 
-> It went very well.
Raina: It went as well as it could have. 
Raina: But it was close, far too close.
Raina: But we’re safe now. 
Raina: ...for now.
Raina: You should go check on the kids.
-> How come?
Raina: They seem pretty shaken. 
Raina: It was rough out there today.
-> And what about you?
Raina: You don’t have to worry about me.
-> The others are worried.
Raina: Oh!
Raina: Are they hurt?
Raina: Maybe I should go check on them-
-> I think they’re worried about you.
Raina: They shouldn’t be.
Raina: I’m fine, I know what I’m doing out there.
-> You’ve fought the Frost before?
Raina: Yes. Not on this scale, but I have.
Raina: I used to be part of the city guard back home.
Raina: It wasn’t frequent, but it was a constant threat.
Raina: Well, more frequent now, compared to a decade ago.
-> Why did you leave?
Raina: It was the right thing to do. 
Raina: Things were getting worse, and I had to do something.
Raina: We fought them off each time, but they just kept coming back.
Raina: It stopped being a legend, a ghost story to tell children at night.
Raina: It was something that happened to a friend of a friend, someone you knew.
Raina: Until my partner was almost taken.[a]
-> What happened?
Raina: We won, but it was close. 
Raina: I thought I was going to lose them forever.
Raina: I couldn’t just stand around and wait for them to come for them again.
Raina: I had to do something, make sure they wouldn’t be back.
-> So you left?
Raina: Yes. I had to. 
Raina: To protect them.
-> But what did they want?
Raina: They… 
Raina: They asked me to stay, but I couldn’t, not without knowing what was going on.
Raina: When they came asking, I volunteered. [b]
Raina: To protect them.
Raina: But I had to leave them behind. 
Raina: They’re safer there, in the city, where there are guards.
-> Do you regret it?
Raina: No. I can’t.
Raina: Can you imagine if it was just Bapy and Soleil out here? 
Raina: They wouldn’t last a day. 
Raina: And that’s if they even got here in one piece.
Raina: What is a kid like Bapy even doing out here, at the end of the world?
-> You’re very worried for them.
Raina: Of course I am! 
Raina: It’s not safe out there. 
Raina: We did fine today. 
Raina: We got Lua back. 
Raina: But it only gets more dangerous from here.[c]
Raina: And Soleil barely listens to me. 
Raina: Better now than before, but I’m scared she’ll do something reckless.
Raina: And Bapy is just so young. 
Raina: If anything happens, it’ll be my fault.
-> You think so?
Raina: What if I’m not fast enough? 
Raina: What if I slip up and one of them gets taken? 
Raina: My partner was fine. 
Raina: We even got Lua back, but what if we aren’t as lucky again? 
-> You’re trying to protect them.
Raina: I have to! 
Raina: If I don’t, who will? 
Raina: But I don’t even know if I can.
-> The others are worried for you too.
Raina: They shouldn’t be. 
Raina: I wish they weren’t.
Raina: I have to be okay, for their sake. 
-> You don’t want them to know?
Raina: No. I can’t put this on them. 
Raina: That’s not fair for them.
-> That’s not fair on you, either?
Raina: I- I suppose not. 
-> You want to hide it from them?
Raina: No. In a way, yes. 
Raina: I don’t want them to see this part of me.
Raina: But to be honest, I’m sure they’ve seen enough.
Raina: But I want to be strong for them.
-> I think the others want to be there for you.
        -> In any way they can.
                -> Maybe you could give them the chance. 
Raina: Maybe I should.
Raina: Or at least, they deserve to know what’s going on.
-> Would you like to go talk to them?
Raina: I will.
Raina: After all, I’m not here alone.

-> Hey, everyone!
Soleil: Hey, Willow.
Bapy: Hi! 
-> Raina wanted to talk to you.
Raina: I did. 
Soleil: Oh. 
Bapy: What’s wrong?
Raina: It’s about how I’ve been acting out there.
Soleil: You mean, how you’ve been fussing over us non-stop? 
Soleil: Never letting Bapy out of your sight?
Bapy: Soleil! 
Raina: No, she’s right.
Raina: I’ve been scared, I think, of not being enough to protect you two.
Soleil: That’s not your job.
Raina: But it is. I can’t let any of you be taken by the Frost. It’s why I’m out here.
Raina: In a way, at least.
Raina: I used to be part of the city guard. 
Raina: I came out here after my partner was attacked.
Raina: They weren’t taken, but it was close. 
Raina: ...
Raina: We got lucky. 
Raina: I had to make sure it wouldn’t happen again. 
Raina: Not to them, not to anyone.
Raina: I thought coming out here and finding the source would give me some peace of mind.
Raina: All I’ve done is fret over you two instead.
Raina: I had to leave [d]them behind, and I don’t know if I did the right thing.
Raina: But that’s all too late now.
Soleil: But you’ll go back. 
Bapy: We’ll get through this. 
Soleil: You’ll just have to make it up to them.
Raina: That won’t be easy. 
Soleil: Me neither. I’m not sure if I can.
Soleil: I left my family behind for this. They don’t even know why I left.
Raina: Ah. You and Lua-
Soleil: Yes.
Bapy: Lua?
Soleil: My family is a traditional one. They wouldn’t have approved, if they’d known. 
Soleil: I couldn’t let them find out. They’d be so disappointed in me.
Soleil: And then after Lua was taken, I couldn’t- I just couldn’t explain.
Soleil: They knew something was wrong, but I didn’t even know where to start.
Soleil: So I ran away. I came out here to get Lua back, but the truth is, I ran away. 
Raina: Oh, Soleil...
Bapy: Is that why you and Lua... 
Soleil: No. Sort of. It’s not why exactly we fought. But it was part of it.
Soleil: She needed to know how serious I was. [e]
Soleil: About her. And us. And I am. 
Soleil: She wanted to meet my parents. 
Soleil: It’s not that she needed me to be out, exactly.
Soleil: But there’s just no version of us, long term, that doesn’t involve them knowing about me. 
Soleil: But I couldn’t let my family find out. I just can’t.
Soleil: If I’d known... I should have known better... 
Soleil: I should have just agreed with her. 
Soleil: If I had, she wouldn’t have been taken.
Bapy: I’m sure that’s not true-
Soleil: I always insisted on meeting in the shadows. [f]
Soleil: Away from crowds. I didn’t want to be seen.
Soleil: If we’d just been in public, or at home, maybe... 
Raina: When my partner was almost taken, they were surrounded by others.
Raina: It was broad daylight.
Raina: Maybe Lua would have been safe, maybe she wouldn’t. But it’s not your fault.
Raina: Not her abduction, or your fight either.
Soleil: But if I’d just done the right thing and agreed-
Raina: I don’t know if there was really a right thing to do.
Raina: You know your family best. 
Raina: Better than Lua. If you couldn’t, you had good reason for it.[g]
Soleil: I thought I did. 
Soleil: I just don’t know if it was worth it, now that Lua... 
Bapy: But we got her back! 
Bapy: We did the impossible, together.
Raina: Lua’s safe now. 
Soleil: Is she? She’s still frozen.[h][i] Where do we go from here?
Soleil: And what if she’s changed when she wakes up? 
Soleil: And that’s if she even wakes up. She might not. 
Soleil: They say the Frost freezes the love out of people. What if...
Bapy: You’re worried she won’t love you anymore?[j]
Soleil: ... 
Bapy: Then you’ll have to get her to fall in love with you again.
Soleil: I-
Raina: You came all this way and did the impossible.
Raina: You never gave up on her before. 
Raina: You can’t give up now.
Soleil: You’re so sure she’ll even wake up.
Raina: If she’s anything like you, she’s a fighter. 
Raina: She’ll pull through.
Soleil: ... 
Soleil: Thank you.
Soleil: I just wish I’d been braver, from the start. 
Soleil: We wouldn’t be in this mess if I’d just... 
Raina: I don’t think it’s just about bravery.
Raina: None of this, the way things are, how your family is, none of that is your fault.
Raina: There’s absolutely nothing wrong with you, Soleil. Not for this. 
Soleil: I-
Soleil: I think I needed to hear that. 
Raina: And you are brave. Both of you are tougher than I gave you credit for.
Raina: It’s just- it’s hard to look past that, tell myself it’s okay to lean on you. 
Raina: You’re all already going through so much.
Bapy: You are too.
Raina: But it’s my job to keep you safe.
Soleil: That’s not your job.
Soleil: It’s not just on you.
Bapy: It’s on all of us. 
Bapy: We can take care of ourselves, and we can take care of each other too.[k]
Soleil: We know we’re just kids, compared to you. 
Soleil: And it helps that you can take the lead.
Soleil: I know I wouldn’t be able to handle things on my own out there.
Bapy: But it’s hard to trust you when you don’t trust us either.[l]
Bapy: I know I don’t know what I’m doing, compared to you two.
Bapy: But I’m learning!
Soleil: It’s true. You’ve improved like crazy since last week.
Raina: You really have. And I’m proud of you both.
Raina: I’m going to try.
Soleil: I get it won’t be easy.
Raina: Yes. But I promise I’ll be doing my best. 
Raina: And I hope you two will feel safe to let me know if I overstep. 
Soleil: Yeah, no problem.
Bapy: Yeah.
Soleil: And thank you for telling us. 
Soleil: It helps, knowing where you’re coming from.
Raina: Yeah, you too. 
Raina: It couldn’t have been easy.
Soleil: I never had the chance to talk about Lua, or us, to anyone.
Soleil: It’s weird. It feels more… real, in a way.
Raina: Yeah, I get that. 
Raina: Thank you, both of you, for giving me a chance to explain myself. For listening. 
Raina: I couldn’t be prouder of you two, I hope you know that.
Soleil: Yeah, me too. 
Bapy: Yeah ... 


[a]Doesn't actually happen, but I forgot to write the backstory timeline lol. I'll get on that
[b]I like this parallel a lot
[c]How would raina know this? Maybe like "the storm is getting stronger or something"
[d]Maybe "left" instead of "had to leave" to show Raina taking ownership of their actions
[e]Lua actually just doesn't understand the problem
[f]little too dramatic
[g]I like this a lot
[h]maybe need an after battle cutscene where the team discovers/recovers luicicle and willow establishes she can melt
[i]Willow knows lua is alive in the ice cube bc ~magic~
[j]This line should go to willow but willow hasn't spoken in a whole page?
[k]Bapy maybe a little too wise
[l]Bapy definitely too wise (soleil would be the one to say this)
