-> I sense… something different about these Frost.
        -> Please be careful.
Raina (battle): Are they getting stronger?
Bapy: Oh no...
-> Not quite... it seems as if-
Soleil: Lua!
Raina: What?
Bapy: Is that-
Soleil: It’s her! That’s Lua, in the Frost! 
Raina: She’s who you came here for, right?
Bapy: But... What do we do?
-> There’s still life in there... 
        -> It’s weak, but I can still feel it.
Bapy: If we get to her... do you think...
-> You would have to break through the ice around her.
Bapy: Will it hurt her?
-> I’m not sure.
Raina: Soleil? This is your call.
Soleil (frustrated): ... 
Soleil (neutral): Let’s do it.
Soleil: Lua, wait for me.
Soleil (frustrated): We’ll save you.

Bapy: ...did we do it…? 
Raina (battle): I think so.
Soleil (frustrated): But the ice…
-> I can hear her heartbeat…
        -> But my fire is too weak to melt through the ice.
Bapy: What if we bring her to the campfire?
-> My flames are not strong enough yet…
        -> But if we grow stronger, perhaps I will be able to thaw her.
Raina: Let’s bring her back.
Raina: We should get out of here.
Soleil: I finally got you back.
Soleil: Lua...
