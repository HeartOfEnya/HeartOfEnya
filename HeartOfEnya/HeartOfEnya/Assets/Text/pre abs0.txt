Raina: Are you sure you’re feeling okay?
Lua: Yup! 
Lua: I was pretty dazed at first... 
Lua: It was like waking up after a bad nap.
Lua: Now I just feel like I’ve had the best night of sleep ever!
Raina (reassuring smile): That’s good to hear.
Lua: I think being near Willow’s flame helped too!
Lua: It’s so warm…
Lua: Almost as warm as Soleil’s heart!
Soleil (shy smile): ...!!! 
-> Thank you.
        -> That’s quite the compliment!
Bapy (smile): I mean, according to Willow... 
Bapy: Soleil’s heart is what makes their flames so warm, right?
-> My flame is fueled by all of your hearts, the love and trust that you share.
        -> So yes, that is true.
Lua: That’s so sweet!
Soleil: ...Fine.
Soleil: It is sweet.
Raina (neutral): Lua... I was meaning to ask... 
Raina: Does that mean you were awake when you were in the ice? 
Lua: Hm... yes, but not quite.
Lua: It’s a little hard to describe.
Lua: I didn’t know where I was, or what was happening...
Lua: But I had a lot of time to think.
Soleil (frustrated): ... I wish I’d gotten here sooner.
Lua: You got here as fast as you could.
Lua: But about that... I do have something to say.
Lua: Earlier today, when we were out fighting the Frost... 
Lua: I felt something familiar. 
Lua: I’m not sure what it was... but it wasn’t good.
Raina: What do you mean?
-> Someone is approaching... 
        -> It seems Absolute Zero has noticed my flame. 
Bapy (neutral): A-absolute Zero?
Raina: Is it because you’ve been getting stronger?
-> I believe so.
        -> Absolute Zero…
                -> He is the one who originally broke the World’s heart.
                        -> The heroes who once lived here gave their lives to stop him.
                                -> It seems he has returned.
Soleil (neutral): But... the blizzard.
Raina (disappointed): Running isn’t an option, is it?
-> Absolute Zero is the cause of the blizzard.
        -> Attempting to journey through it right now would be facing him at full power.
Lua: Then we’ll have to stay and fight.
Raina (reassuring smile): At least we’ll have a chance to protect everyone back home. 
Bapy (neutral): But… he sounds really strong.
Bapy (frustrated): And I’m... me.
Bapy (neutral): The heroes back then... 
Raina: They’re still with us now.
Raina: We’ll be fighting with them at our backs, right?
-> Yes.
        -> They will be at your side.
Soleil (shy smile): And Bapy…
Soleil: I don’t think we’d have gotten here without you.
Soleil: We wouldn’t stand a chance without you by our side. 
-> You’ve come very far, Bapy. 
Bapy (smile): ...you’re right. 
Bapy: We’ll fight him, and we’ll win.
Bapy: And we’ll be out of here in no time.
Lua: That’s the spirit!
Raina: Willow... do you know when we’ll have to face Absolute Zero?
-> His approach is very near…
Raina: Then we’ll be ready.
