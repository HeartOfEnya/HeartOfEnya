Bapy: It’s so cold... 
Raina (battle): Is that…?
Lua: That’s him.
-> Absolute Zero. It’s him... at the heart of the Frost. 
        -> This will be your final fight. 
                    -> I am with you. We can do this. 
Abs0: That voice... I heard it, long ago...
Abs0: Is that... Enya?
-> No, although Enya's spirit lives on within me.
        -> I am born of the heroes who laid down their lives to stop you.
                -> And carry the strength of the heroes who stand before you now.
Bapy: We've come so far...
Raina: We're not stopping now.
Soleil: We can do this!

Raina (battle): The storm... it’s getting weaker. 
Lua: Did we do it?

Raina (battle): What was that?
-> Absolute Zero has been weakened.
        -> If you hurry, you should be able to leave the Outpost safely.
Soleil: But what happens here?
-> The storm will return, stronger than before.
        -> If we continue to fight we may be able to weaken him even more.
                -> However, all the remaining Frost will be coming.
                        -> And we can only try this once before the storm returns.
                                -> Be careful.

Bapy: The storm has stopped!
Soleil: Does this mean-
Lua: We did it!
Raina: Is he gone?
-> Absolute Zero has fled to the frozen wastelands to recover.
        -> He will never truly be gone, as long as the world’s heart is frozen.
                -> But the storm has stopped, and the Frost has retreated as well.
Bapy: We... we actually did it!
-> Let's return to the Outpost.
