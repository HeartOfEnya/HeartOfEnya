Bapy: The storm has stopped!
Soleil: Does this mean-
Lua: We did it!
Raina: Is he gone?
-> Absolute Zero has fled for the frozen wastelands to recover.
        -> He will never truly be gone, as long as the world’s heart is frozen.

abs 0 or abs zero
Should be written as "Absolute Zero"
very up to revision it gives the vibe squad gonna die to and i Don't Like that
is this presented in a "reach the escape tiles" or do 2 buttons show up yes/no and the player picks?
