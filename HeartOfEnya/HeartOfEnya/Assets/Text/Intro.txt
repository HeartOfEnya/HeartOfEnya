-> The storm is getting stronger... 
        -> I hope the adventurers make it through okay…
Bapy: O-oh! Hello. [d]
-> I am glad to see you have made it here safely.
Raina: The trail of floating lights that led us here... 
Raina: That was you, wasn’t it?[e]
-> Yes.
Raina: Thank you. We could barely see through the blizzard outside.
Soleil: And who are you?
-> I go by Willow Wisp, spirit of the hearth. 
        -> I guide the adventurers who gather by my fire.
                ->  And what should I call you?
Raina: Raina. I go by he/him or they/them.
Raina: And this is B-
Bapy: I’m Bapy[g]! They/them. I think. I’m not sure yet.[h]
Soleil: Marisol Alayama. I go by Soleil. She/hers.
Soleil: We’re headed to the Outpost at the End of the World.
Soleil: Can you guide us there as well?
-> This is the Outpost.
        -> Or at least, what remains of it.
Bapy: W-what?
Bapy: But it’s so barren outside!
Raina: What happened here...
-> There was a last stand here, long ago.
        -> The heroes traded their lives to slow the Frost. 
                -> But lately... it seems as if they have returned in greater numbers.
Bapy: No…
Bapy: So everyone’s...gone?
Raina: We hadn’t heard. [i]
Raina: No one has returned from the Outpost for years...
Raina: The heroes of legend... were just as helpless?[j]
Soleil: I don’t… this can’t be true.
Soleil: How do you know this?
Bapy: You’re not... a ghost... are you?
-> No, though the spirits of the heroes live on within me.
        -> This was the fire they gathered at each night.
                -> And now, I protect those that come here from the cold outside.
                        -> You will be safe from the Frost by my fire.
Soleil: And if we want to go and fight?
Bapy: W-what?
Raina: Weren’t you listening? 
Raina: The heroes-
Soleil: They’re gone. But that was a long time ago.
Soleil: I came here to fight the Frost.
Soleil: I’ll go alone if I have to.
-> The Frost is a dangerous enemy.
        -> I would advise you to leave for your own safety...
                -> But you are trapped here unless you stop the blizzard.
Soleil: Then it’s decided. What other choice do we have?
Raina: I suppose... 
Bapy: But...how do we stop the blizzard?
-> The Frost, gathered together, has driven the storm out of control.
Soleil: So we just have to defeat enough of them?
Soleil: Fine. Let’s go. 
-> My form must remain here[k]
        -> But I can still speak to you if you bring my flame with you.[l]
                ->Here, take these lanterns.
Bapy: Thank you!
Raina: We’ll need all the help we can get.
Soleil: Come on, let’s go. 



[a]Things established in prologue:
from willow's pov?
Enya and her group
adventurers join sometimes
[b]Start at empty campfire with only willow visually?
[c]the characters fade in???
[d]Change to have the first few lines be the characters happy to have survived the blizzard, wondering where they are, and wondering who made the fire / if this place is occupied
[e]Maybe the characters should be more surprised to see like... a fire spirit I feel like that's not something thats very common
[f]Consider not specifying adventurers here
[g]i wanted to use first names but bapy is still listed as bapy o'lastname ;w;
[h]Change to Bapy introducing themselves, then Raina prompting them to say what their pronouns are
[i]Feels weird? Like how Raina would say about like a distant family member passing instead of like, the heroes who are supposed to be saving the world.
[j]Weird wording
[k]This form of mine, or this part of me, or something
[l]Should directly reference advising in combat
[m]a pop up graphic of a lantern?
