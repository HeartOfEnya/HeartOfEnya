-> The storm is getting stronger... 
        -> I hope the adventurers make it through okay…
Raina: The light up ahead…
Raina: Let’s go, we need somewhere to wait out the storm.
Bapy: Is it safe?
Raina: I’ll go first.

Raina: Come on, it’s warm inside.
//bapy & soleil enter
<<fadeIn Soleil>>
Soleil: A fire...?
<<fadeIn Bapy>>
Bapy: Ah, I haven’t been warm in so long... 
Raina: Where are we?
-> Hello, travelers.
Bapy: O-oh! Hi there!
Bapy: Y-you... can talk?
-> I am glad to see you have made it here safely.
Soleil: And who are you?
-> I go by Willow Wisp, spirit of the hearth. 
        -> I guide any adventurers who gather by my fire.
Bapy: A fire spirit?
Raina: I’ve only heard of them in legends...
Raina: The trail of floating lights that led us here... 
Raina (reassuring smile): Was that you?
-> Yes. I sensed your arrival and wished to help.
Raina (smile eyes closed): I see... 
Bapy: But... 
Bapy: How do we know you’re telling the truth?
Soleil (frustrated): We don’t have much of a choice, do we?
Soleil (neutral): Or would you rather go back out into the storm?
Bapy: ... 
Raina (neutral): I think we can trust them.
Raina: At least, the fire spirits of legends were always kind.
Raina (reassuring smile): Thank you, Willow. 
Raina: We could barely see through the blizzard outside.
-> I’m happy to have helped!
        -> What shall I call you?
Raina: Raina. I go by he/him or they/them.
Raina: And this is B-
Bapy (smile): I’m Bapy! 
Raina (neutral): And your pronouns?
Bapy (neutral): Oh.
Bapy: I- um. I’m not sure. 
Bapy: I was- I don’t know what they should be.
-> Whatever you like is fine.
Bapy(smile): They/them, then. I think. 
-> Nice to meet you, Bapy!
        -> And finally-
Soleil: Marisol Alayama. I go by Soleil. She/hers.
Soleil: We’re headed to the Outpost at the End of the World.
Soleil: Can you guide us there as well?
-> This is the Outpost.
        -> Or at least, what remains of it.
Bapy (neutral): W-what?
Bapy: But it’s so barren outside!
Raina: What happened here...
-> There was a last stand here, long ago.
        -> The heroes traded their lives to slow the Frost. 
                -> But lately... it seems as if they have returned in greater numbers.
Bapy (frustrated): No…
Bapy (disappointed): So everyone’s...gone?
Raina: That’s impossible! 
Raina: No one has returned from the Outpost for years…
Raina (disappointed): We thought that they were still fighting.
Raina: The heroes of legend... they were our last line of defense.
Soleil (frustrated): I don’t… this can’t be true.
Soleil (neutral): How do you know this?
Bapy (neutral): You’re not... a ghost... are you?
-> No, though the spirits of the heroes live on within me.
        -> This was the fire they gathered at each night.
                -> And now, I protect those that come here from the cold outside.
                        -> You will be safe from the Frost by my fire.
Soleil: And if we want to go and fight?
Bapy: W-what?
Raina (neutral): Weren’t you listening? 
Raina (disappointed): The heroes-
Soleil: They’re gone. But that was a long time ago.
Soleil: I came here to fight the Frost.
Soleil (frustrated): I’ll go alone if I have to.
-> The Frost is a dangerous enemy.
        -> I would advise you to leave for your own safety…
                -> But you are trapped here unless you stop the blizzard.
Soleil (neutral): Then it’s decided. What other choice do we have?
Raina: I suppose... 
Bapy: But...how do we stop the blizzard?
-> The Frost, gathered together, has driven the storm out of control.
Soleil: So we just have to defeat enough of them?
Soleil: Fine. Let’s go. 
-> This form of mine must remain here to guard the outpost.
        -> But I can still speak to you if you bring my flame with you.
                ->Here, take these lanterns.
                        -> I’ll be able to guide you from far away.
   
Bapy (smile): Thank you!
Raina (neutral): We’ll need all the help we can get.
Soleil: Come on, let’s go.
