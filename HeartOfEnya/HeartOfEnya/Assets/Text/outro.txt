-> It’s so quiet, now that the storm is over.
Raina (reassuring smile): It is, isn’t it? Everything seems so calm now.
Soleil: It still doesn’t feel real, somehow. 
Bapy (smile): But in a good way, right?
Soleil (shy smile): Yeah. 
-> You finally can leave the Outpost safely.
        -> What will you do now?
Raina (neutral): Things aren’t finished yet.
Raina: People need to know about what happened here at the Outpost…
Raina: And how much time we have before Absolute Zero comes back.
Bapy (neutral): I mean, I was thinking... 
Bapy: Maybe I could stay behind with you?
Bapy: It’s just- I don’t want you to be alone here... 
-> Oh, Bapy…
        -> The spirits of the heroes live on within me.
                -> Here, at the fire they ate at, I don’t think I will ever be lonely
                        -> Although I will miss you all.
                                -> But you don’t have to worry about me.
Bapy: But... could we take you with us?
Bapy: In our lanterns, like we used to into battle?
Bapy (smile): It’s not quite the same... but this way you could see the world too!
-> Oh!
        -> I’d like that.
                -> I won’t be able to speak to you, far from the hearth... 
                        -> But I am strengthened by those that gather at my fire.
                                -> Perhaps we could meet again, then.
Bapy: Then we’ll take you with us! 
-> That sounds lovely.
        -> Where will you go?
Raina: We need to spread the news, make sure that people are ready.
Raina (reassuring smile): But mostly, I can’t wait to see my partner again.
Raina: I can’t wait for them to meet you all.
-> You must miss them.
Raina: I do. I have so much to say.
-> Are you nervous?
Raina: Yes. 
Raina: But I think I’ll be fine, now. 
Raina: Whatever happens next, I’ll get through just fine.
-> I believe you.
Soleil (shy smile): Lua and I... 
Lua: We’re definitely coming along! 
Soleil: We’ve got plenty of things to figure out.
Soleil: Before we can even think about settling down. 
Soleil: Or heading home. 
Lua: Besides, we’ve always loved the idea of traveling, seeing the world.
Lua: Maybe we could stop by my family.
Soleil: O-oh. You’re sure?
Lua: Of course! They’ll love you.
Soleil: That sounds nice.
Lua: I can’t wait for them to meet all of you!
Lua: I don’t think they’ve ever met a talking fire before.
-> I can’t wait to meet them too.
        -> Bapy, what about you?
Bapy: Well, we’re going to go see my siblings.
Bapy: I can’t wait to show them how much I’ve grown.
Bapy: And I really want everyone to meet them!
Bapy (neutral): After that... 
Bapy: I just want to see the world. See what it is I want to do.
Bapy: I’ve got plenty of time to figure out what I want. 
-> That sounds lovely. 
Bapy (smile): It does, doesn’t it.
Bapy (neutral): ...
Raina (smile eyes closed): …
Raina (reassuring smile): It seems like it’s time for us to get going now.
Raina (reassuring smile): Thank you for everything you’ve done for us.
Soleil (neutral): Stay safe, alright?
Soleil: I-
Soleil (frustrated): I’m going to miss you.
Lua: We’ll be thinking of you.
Soleil (shy smile): Yeah…
Bapy: …
Raina: Is there something you’d like to say, Bapy?
Bapy: …
Bapy: ...
Bapy (cry): …
-> It’s okay to be sad. 
        -> What did you want to say?
Bapy: … 
Bapy: You’ll be with us, right?
-> Every step of the way.
        -> But for now, it really is time to get going.
                -> ...
                        -> Goodbye, everyone.
Raina: Goodbye, Willow.
